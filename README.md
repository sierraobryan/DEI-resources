The Leaky Tech Pipeline Research

**Overview of The Leaky Tech Pipeline** 
The Leaky Tech Pipeline framework and website are meant to increase understanding of the causes of disparities in the technology ecosystem, raise awareness about effective strategies and stages for intervention, and drive the development and implementation of comprehensive solutions.

**Overview** 
What factors contribute to the lack of diversity in the tech workforce? Biases in the recruitment process, resume review, and interview stage prevent professionals from diverse backgrounds from being hired, while negative workplace culture, harassment, biases in promotion, and pay inequality contribute to the lack of satisfaction and turnover of women and people of color. The Leaky TechPipeline explores these themes in their research and publishes their results.

## Stop Hiring As If We’re In The Industrial Age
Podcast by Kim Crayton 

**Abstract**
Change is happening all around us, and yet, the tech industry continues to hire developers and build teams that are still stuck in the Industrial Age matrix. Everyone is sick and tired of being asked, "Are you technical?" Wake up! We are in the Information Age where diversity and inclusion is now part of smart business planning. Shed the outdated silo thinking that developers are only responsible for code. Success in today’s knowledge economy requires that all team members understand how every decision impacts business leaders ability to innovate, differentiate, and gain competitive advantage.

What the job listing says– and doesn’t say– plays a huge role in who applies for the job. Typical postings use dynamic, action-oriented verbs combined with generous helpings of industry jargon and endless lists of requirements. This language attracts a very specific type of job seeker. Often, for others, the message is “You don’t belong here.” How to rewrite your job posting with inclusive and welcoming language.

## Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality
Research Paper

**Overview**
The current research highlights one such institutional-level feature and demonstrates its potential impact on judgments relevant to the maintenance of inequality. In doing so, it provides useful advances for our understanding of gender inequality in the workforce. But beyond that, we hope it highlights the power of looking to features of the social structure— especially those that may easily go unnoticed—in helping social psychologists uncover the ways in which social inequality is created, reinforced, and ultimately maintained.

Twitter Thread

**Key takeaways** 
This question can cause your interviewee to relive past trauma while causing current trauma as they scramble to answer what could be a deeply personal question with a professional adequate answer. Many black women (and other underrepresented groups) leave because of toxic cultures.

## Stretch Opportunities 
Twitter thread

**Key takeaways**
A stretch opportunity is a project, scope, or responsibility, that as a little bit beyond what someone has done before in your context. A good stretch opportunity will require your team member to apply intentional focus to shore up their "growing edge", may require support from a mentor, and should take place in a supportive environment.
While this thread is about promoting your juniors, it can also apply to the folks being interviewed. Do they have potential? Can you help grow them with mentorship and support?

## Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills
Article

**Overview**
