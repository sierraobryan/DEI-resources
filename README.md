### Introduction 
I am a priviledged white woman without lived experiences and I care a lot about DE&I in tech. Because of this, I am always trying to learn more from the experts. I follow, subscribe to, and learn a lot from so many smart folks who dedicate their lives and work to making tech a more diverse and inclusive place and share valuable wisdom through their content, whether that be twitter threads, articles, newsletters, blogs, podcasts and more. This is a psuedo organized, categorized, and maintained list of those resources they share which I have found eyeopening, helpful, interesting and important so that they are easy to find in the future (it's too easy for those resources to fall further down my TL or get shuffled into old emails and lost forever in the internet void) to continue my own journey to driving impactful change in tech. 

### Where do I get these resources?

I follow a lot of really smart folks on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_sierraobryan), I subscribe to the [Business & Ally Newsletter](https://www.diversifytech.co/business-ally-newsletter/) of [Diversify Tech](https://www.diversifytech.co/), I’m a member of [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/) and there are a lot of great articles posted on in their [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/techladies), I’m part of [Elpha](https://elpha.com), I subscribed to the [Black Tech Pipeline](https://blacktechpipeline.com/) newsletter

### The Subtle Art of Hiring a Diverse Workforce  
Blog by Carolie Chavier

**Overview**

### Bias in Hiring Research (and more!) 
The Leaky Tech Pipeline Research

**Overview of The Leaky Tech Pipeline**  
The Leaky Tech Pipeline framework and website are meant to increase understanding of the causes of disparities in the technology ecosystem, raise awareness about effective strategies and stages for intervention, and drive the development and implementation of comprehensive solutions.

**Overview**  
What factors contribute to the lack of diversity in the tech workforce? Biases in the recruitment process, resume review, and interview stage prevent professionals from diverse backgrounds from being hired, while negative workplace culture, harassment, biases in promotion, and pay inequality contribute to the lack of satisfaction and turnover of women and people of color. The Leaky TechPipeline explores these themes in their research and publishes their results.

### On improving Diversity in Hiring
Blog by [Cate](https://twitter.com/catehstn)

**Key takeaways**  
Don’t hire people into an environment they can’t be successful in. On a practical level, it’s a waste of everyone’s time. On a human level, it’s harmful.

Interview with Hilliary Turnispeed 

**Key takeaways**  
Build relationships in the tech community, listen to your current employees and rethink how you do interviews. At the end of the day, companies need to define who they are before they can be successful in those efforts. They should be asking: What are our operating philosophies and values? And what does it mean to be a leader in our organization? What will leaders be held accountable for?

Blog by Lori Mackenzie, Alison Wynn, and Shelley J. Correll

**Key takeaways**  
The signals your company sends about its culture greatly influence whether you are able to attract — or alienate — women. When deciding whether to join (or stay at) your company, candidates and employees may consciously or subconsciously pay attention to the following signals to gauge whether your workplace culture is one where they can thrive: The number of women and people of color in leadership roles, Narrow descriptors in job posts, Narrow descriptors in job posts, and Opportunities for development and mentorship.

### We’re Hiring Engineers All Wrong. Here’s How HuffPost Evolved       
Blog by Alan Johnson  

**Abstract**      
There’s a great deal of research out there on best practices for interviewing. But for whatever reason, it seems the software industry has gravitated toward a set of practices that don’t really align with the goal of hiring the right people. And we at HuffPost have fallen into some of these pitfalls in the past. What follows is an account of how we have rethought our engineering hiring practices.

### Stop Hiring As If We’re In The Industrial Age
Podcast by Kim Crayton 

**Abstract**  
Change is happening all around us, and yet, the tech industry continues to hire developers and build teams that are still stuck in the Industrial Age matrix. Everyone is sick and tired of being asked, "Are you technical?" Wake up! We are in the Information Age where diversity and inclusion is now part of smart business planning. Shed the outdated silo thinking that developers are only responsible for code. Success in today’s knowledge economy requires that all team members understand how every decision impacts business leaders ability to innovate, differentiate, and gain competitive advantage.

## Job Post 

### Not Applicable: What Your Job Post is Really Saying 
Blog by Coraline Ada Ehmke 

**Key takeaways**  
What the job listing says– and doesn’t say– plays a huge role in who applies for the job. Typical postings use dynamic, action-oriented verbs combined with generous helpings of industry jargon and endless lists of requirements. This language attracts a very specific type of job seeker. Often, for others, the message is “You don’t belong here.” How to rewrite your job posting with inclusive and welcoming language.

### Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality
Research Paper

**Overview**  
The current research highlights one such institutional-level feature and demonstrates its potential impact on judgments relevant to the maintenance of inequality. In doing so, it provides useful advances for our understanding of gender inequality in the workforce. But beyond that, we hope it highlights the power of looking to features of the social structure— especially those that may easily go unnoticed—in helping social psychologists uncover the ways in which social inequality is created, reinforced, and ultimately maintained. (Selected from the paper)

### Technical Interviews – An Instrument of Exclusion and Discrimination
Blog by Chris 

**Key takeaways** 
An argument for abolishing the technical interview - the blog bebunks some long standing myths about hiring developers using a technical interview with the final take away: "[N]ot everyone came from a privileged engineering background like yourself, and you shouldn’t judge someone based on their background alone. Technical interviews allow you to be exclusionary without even realizing it. People are wonderfully diverse, don’t be so closed minded."

### Why I Don’t Have Time For Your Coding Challenge  
Blog on CSS { In Real Life }   

**Key takeaways** 
Coding Challenges are time-consuming, counter-productive and arbitrary. Consider these alternatives to a coding challenge: ask pertinent questions (and trust in the answers), have a probationary period, walk through their existing projects, ask them to build something they enjoy, pair program and focus on their ability to learn.

### Don’t ask Black women why they left their last company 
Twitter Thread by Naya Moss

**Key takeaways**  
This question can cause your interviewee to relive past trauma while causing current trauma as they scramble to answer what could be a deeply personal question with a professional adequate answer. Many black women (and other underrepresented groups) leave because of toxic cultures.
Better questions are “why are you interested in our company?” or about what did you like/dislike previous *technical* projects, languages, frameworks, etc.

### Stretch Opportunities 
Twitter thread by Mekka Okereke

**Key takeaways**  
A stretch opportunity is a project, scope, or responsibility, that as a little bit beyond what someone has done before in your context. A good stretch opportunity will require your team member to apply intentional focus to shore up their "growing edge", may require support from a mentor, and should take place in a supportive environment.
While this thread is about promoting your juniors, it can also apply to the folks being interviewed. Do they have potential? Can you help grow them with mentorship and support?

### Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills
Article

**Overview**   
For this study, researchers conducted technical interviews where half of the study participants were given a conventional whiteboard technical interview (with an interviewer looking on) and other half of the participants were asked to solve their problem on a whiteboard in a private room. People who took the traditional interview performed half as well as people that were able to interview in private. 
Recommendations: Use retrospective think-aloud for accessing explanation skills, evaluate the kinds of stress necessary for position, provide accessible alternatives

### Debugging Hiring: What Went Right and What Went Wrong in the Technical Interview
Research paper

**Overview**  
A study from North Carolina State University and Microsoft finds that the technical interviews currently used in hiring for many software engineering positions test whether a job candidate has performance anxiety rather than whether the candidate is competent at coding. The interviews may also be used to exclude groups or favor specific job candidates.

**Recommendations**  
Recruit widely and tailor communications to your candidates, Help candidates prepare for your interviews, Develop standards and train interviewers, Inform candidates of where they are in the interview process, and give constructive feedback to them, Negotiate not just the immediate the offer but invest in long-term career growth

### Hiring is Broken: What Do Developers Say About Technical Interviews?
Research Paper 

**Overview**  
A study from North Carolina State University  and Microsoft found that many developers in the software engineering community felt the technical interview process was deeply flawed. So the researchers decided to run a study aimed at assessing the effect of the interview process on aspiring software engineers.

**Recommendations**
